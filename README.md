This is a simple emoji search built with [React.js](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJ58jn9-7cAhXSzVMKHfEUCdYQFjAAegQIABAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Freactjs.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw26YbpVhaFnAB4A6G8-4uAs). 

## Getting Started

Check out the [live demo](https://ryanmack-crypto-tracker.herokuapp.com/)!

You can search by keyword or by emoji name. If you click on the row, that emoji will be copied to the clipboard!

## Built With

## Acknowledgements

I got the idea for the project while browsing [React Example Projects](https://reactjs.org/community/examples.html). 

The example project was built by [Andrew Farmer](https://github.com/ahfarmer).
